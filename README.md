Builds happen automatically when pushed to GH using GH Actions. To preview changes before pushing to the repo run `hugo server`.

Posts of various kinds are located in the `content/` folder.

Static content (images, css, etc.) should be stored in `static/`. The recommendation for images used for posts is 512 px. You can resize images easily using ImageMagick with the command `magick convert <src> -resize x512 <dest>`
