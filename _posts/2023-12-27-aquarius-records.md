Aquarius Records was a record shop in the Mission District in San Francisco. In contrast to the well more-known Amoeba Records in the Haight, Aquarius was a tiny shop with a laser focus on all the weird and experimental music you could hope for. My collection of Circle albums got out of control from living a few blocks away from there. But probably the thing they were most famous for was how the staff would write up these detailed reviews of the albums there. It was a true labor of love, and the collection of reviews represents a really valuable trove of writing about a lot of obscure and interesting music. Although the record store is no more, calling it quits sometime in late 2015/early 2016, thanks to the preservation efforts of the Internet Archive you can [still browse those reviews](https://web.archive.org/web/20150321120547/http://www.aquariusrecords.org/)
